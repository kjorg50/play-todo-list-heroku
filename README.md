# To-Do List

This is a sample Play application that keeps a todo list. The basic model is a `Task`, so tasks can be created and deleted
dynamically. It uses eBean as an ORM to store and retrieve the objects from a database. The tutorial can be found
[here](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/JavaTodoList) (The instructions are mostly accurate, even though
they are for Play version 2.1.0).

## Usage

To run the app locally, perform `activator run` and then go to localhost:9000 in your browser.

## Heroku deployment

Follow the documentation [here](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ProductionHeroku).
