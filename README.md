# To-Do List

This is a sample Play application that keeps a todo list. The basic model is a `Task`, so tasks can be created and deleted
dynamically. It uses eBean as an ORM to store and retrieve the objects from a database. The tutorial can be found
[here](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/JavaTodoList)(Most of the instructions are the same, even though I used Play
version 2.3.0).

## Usage

* To run the app locally, perform the following command and then go to localhost:9000 in your browser.

`activator run`

## Heroku deployment

Follow the documentation [here](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ProductionHeroku).
